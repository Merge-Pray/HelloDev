## About

HelloDev is the capstone project of our one-year Web Development course at the **Digital Career Institute (DCI)**  
*(September 2024 – September 2025)*.  
It is a **full-stack social network built by developers, for developers**, designed and implemented end-to-end by our team.

Core development took place **11 August – 21 September 2025**.  
The project is live and open for exploration, but intended as a **learning and showcase platform**, not for permanent production use.
